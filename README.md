**Input instruction:**
* I included one more input than you provided in the document which is for No.of input populations you want to give for Initial Generation. Based on this only you are able to give the population position of generation ZERO.
    <p>For example: if you give this 3, then you are able to give only 3 set values in the population position of the initial generation, like in the above image.</p>
* I have given the input for population position of generation ZERO as split value, so please give it in following syntax,
    <pre>value1 <space> value  2 <enter>
    value3 <space> value  4 <enter>
    value5 <space> value  6 <enter></pre>
